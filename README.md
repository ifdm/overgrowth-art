## Conventions

### Naming Files

The contents of the file are the first identifier in the file name. This brief description is all lowercase and hyphenated. The description is followed by an underscore and the the dimensions of the image, separating width from height by an 'x'.
- contents-of-file_widthxheight.extension;

If the contents pertain to a specific component of an object, the object is named first and then the component. For example,
- player-left-arm_250x250.png

### File Formats

PNG or JPG.

### Image Dimensions

- Backgrounds: 2650 x 1600
- Proportionality: All objects are drawn to the scale with the maximum background size. This means when your objects are placed in the level, they look appropriately sized relative to other objects and the background.
